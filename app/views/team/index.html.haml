              I am a 200 hour certified Vinyasa yoga teacher who is registered with the Yoga Alliance. I received my training at Bhakti Barn Yoga in Millburn, NJ under the instruction of the wonderful Betsy Davis, among other incredible yoga teachers and scholars. My goal in every class is to bring my students to a safe, comfortable environment where they can have fun, embrace a challenge, and truly live in the present moment. Teaching yoga is a true honor and I love interacting with my students, watching them grow, and having plenty of laughs along the way. Yoga is all about living in the present moment, learning about the self, and having fun!

              My classes are designed for yogis and yoginis at all levels of practice. My classes incorporate  various combinations of Vinyasa flow, balancing, standing and floor asana, inversions, and the most important pose, Savasana. Yoga as a practice can benefit both the mind and the body. An improvement in mental focus, clearer thinking, more physical strength, and an increase in energy are just some benefits related to the practice of yoga.  Get ready to play with movement and balance and enjoy the beautiful flow of yoga with me!
